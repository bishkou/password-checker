### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/bishkou/password-checker)

## Install

```sh
npm i password-pwnd
```

## Password Has been leaked before ?

```js
// pwnd checks if the password your provided has been found in previous leaks
const { pwnd } = require('password-pwnd')

check = async () => {
    /* 
     Make sure to use the await syntax since we're fetching
    data from an API and it can take a second to get the result
    */
    const leak = await pwnd('password123')

    // if the value is 0
    if (!leak) {
        console.log('You Are Good To Go')
    }
    // if the value is different from 0
    else  console.log('Please change your password, it has been found in a previous leak')
    

    /* if you want to get the count of how many times the password
     have been found in previous breaches
    */
    const count = await pwnd('password123')
    console.log(`Password found ${count} times`)
    
    

}

```
**DISCLAIMER** :
If the Password isn't found when calling the API
That doesn't necessarily mean it's a good password,
 merely that it's not indexed on this API
 
**BUT** Testing the password against **613,584,246** real leaked passowrds
is a good **INDICATOR** that the password is somewhat **SECURE**


## Catching Errors
```js
/* I Highly recommend you try to catch errors since we are making
 a call to an API and it can fail at any given moment
    */
const leak = await pwnd('password')
    .catch(err => {
        console.log(err)
    })
```

## Password Strong Enough ?

```js
// pwnd checks if the password your provided has been found in previous leaks
const { strong } = require('password-pwnd')

check = async () => {
    /* Enter the password desired
     Make sure to use the await syntax since we're fetching
    data from an API and it can take a second to get the result
    */
    const strength = await strong('password123')
    // if the value is 0
    if (!strength) {
        console.log('You Are Good To Go')
    }
    // if the value is different from 0
    else  console.log('Your Password is Weak')

}

```

## HOW DOES THIS WORK
In order to protect the value of the source password being searched for,
Pwned Passwords also implements a k-Anonymity model that allows a password 
to be searched for by partial hash.<br/> This allows the first 5 characters of
a SHA-1 password hash (not case-sensitive) to be passed to the API (testable by [clicking here](https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/21BD1))
<br />
<br />
When a password hash with the same first 5 characters is found in the Pwned Passwords repository,
the API will respond with an HTTP 200 and include the suffix of every hash beginning with
the specified prefix, followed by a count of how many times it appears in the data set.
The API consumer can then search the results of the response for the presence of their source hash
and if not found, the password does not exist in the data set.
